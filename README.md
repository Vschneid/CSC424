Securing a web application


Instructions:<br/>
      From root directory, use the command "npm start". This will concurrently run the backend API and the frontend build<br/>
      as configured in my package.json files.<br/>

      package.json file as well.<br/>
  <br/>
 Vulnerabilities Found:<br/>
      I was running an older version of npm and axios (as well as cors), which revealed vulnerabilites in my risk <br/>assessment
